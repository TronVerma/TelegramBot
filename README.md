# TelegramBot

This is my first attempt in making a telegram bot.

It returns stock value of commodities on stock exchange.
I've used Selenium framework to scrape the internet.

It is still under construction.

It has two cases of returns

In first case
  it returns only the stock value
  
The second case is of an arbitration
  In such a situation list of companies are returned. Out of which a specific company's price is returned (under work)
  
The program is very slow, and consumes a lot of RAM as it opens the entire Firefox browser.
